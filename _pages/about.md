I am currently a Research Fellow in the College of Computing and Data Science at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, and also with the National Centre for Research in Digital Trust (DTC), Singapore, working with [Prof. Lam Kwok Yan](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/kwokyan.lam/). 

Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Sun Yat-sen University, advised by [Prof. Liang Lin](http://www.linliang.net/) in [HCP-I2 Lab](https://www.sysu-hcp.net/home/). I also possess a wealth of experience in the corporate world. Concretely, I have ever interned at [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/cn/?ic_medium=direct&ic_source=surlent), worked at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/), and served as a senior technical consultant at [SenseTime](https://www.sensetime.com/en).



News

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
